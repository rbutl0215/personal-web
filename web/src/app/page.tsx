            As a transformative Full Stack Software Engineer, I specialize in
            bringing ideas to life with precision and flair. My expertise lies
            in creating dynamic user experiences with React and powering
            feature-rich backend systems using Ruby on Rails. I am adept in
            TypeScript and JavaScript, with a mastery in building scalable
            applications leveraging GraphQL, Postgres, Docker, GitHub workflows,
            AWS, and Azure. I am not just about code; I am about creating
            seamless bridges between technology and business needs. Whether
            managing teams, architecting a pivotal service, or coding the next
            innovation, my goal remains constant: deliver with excellence. Iâ€™m
            on the lookout for challenges that push the envelope and allow me to
            leverage my diverse skill set for transformative results.
